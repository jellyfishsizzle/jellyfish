title: Notes (technical and otherwise)
---
After much deliberation on what will go here, I'm still not completely sure.  I've decided I am not going to have a "typical" notes or cheatsheets section.  There are already some really great collections of notes and cheatsheets that would be pointless to try and recreate and most of them are in the [resources section](/resources.md).  

Instead, I think I'm going to use this space for things that I have done (or are doing) that I don't want to get buried in a blog post.  Expect more completely random things regarding computers, food and travel.

For now this is just going to be a work in progress.  Who knows?  I might get rid of it completely.
