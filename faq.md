* Do you really need an FAQ for a blog?
: Yes!  The "About" page doesn't really cover everything.

* What did you use to create this site?
: It's a combination of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) along with some other bits of code I've found around the interwebs.

* Who are you?
: I'm a security enthusiast, sysadmin and all around geek.

* Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
: What is a better use of my time other than giving my unwanted opinion?

* How often will there be a new blog posting?
: When the mood strikes me.

* How long should you wait to go into the water after you've eaten?
: At least 30 minutes.

* What kind of music do you like?
: Depends on my mood and who I'm with.  Pretty much anything but country.

* What's wrong with country music?
: So many things.  I've tried to like it.  I've worked with people that
listen to nothing but country.  It's just not my thing.

* Why is the sky blue?
: Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions
by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more
than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.

: It is a dead giveaway.

* How much Red Bull can someone drink and not die?
: According to [Caffiene Calculator](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/death-by-caffeine) I can drink 170 cans and still be safe.  Although, I'd probably be pretty sick.

* Is there a map of the internet?
: The Carna botnet was comprised of 420,000 devices created by an anonymous researcher to measure the extent of the Internet in what the creator called the “Internet Census of 2012”.  More details about how it went down and the resulting map can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carna_botnet)

* Where is the best place to go for a vacation?
: My current favorite destination is Japan.  However, that is subject to change since I haven't been everywhere yet.

* What time is it?
: Check out the [NIST Official Official Map](https://www.time.gov/).  If you are outside the US, you're out of luck.  According to the page "The .gov means it’s official."

* Why does this site use a ".xyz" domain?  
: I saw a couple other sites using it and thought it was cool.  It also makes it a little different.  I like to be different.
