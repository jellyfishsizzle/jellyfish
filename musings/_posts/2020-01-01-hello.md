Usually "hello world" is the first post.  It could also be the first thing you do with a program or just used as a general example for something.  In this case, it's not my first post.  I've started various blogs on various platforms with various formats and given up on all of them.  It's not that they all suck (they probably do), it's just not my thing.  I could list all the things I didn't like about any of them, but that's not really the point.  The point is this isn't really my first shot at this.  Let's see what happens.

I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it.  Facebook steals your data and does terrible things things with it.  I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook.  I'm not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat or pretty much any other social media.  I guess it stems from not having so many friends.  Reddit is my go-to for many things, but it's not really the appropriate place for a blog and I'm too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things anonymous.

So here we are.  Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say.  No friends, likes, dislikes or funny captions.  I might not even allow comments.  But for now it is what it is.
