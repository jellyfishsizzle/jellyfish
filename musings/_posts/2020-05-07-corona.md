With the uncertainty of the world as we know it, it's never been easier to prey on people's fear and good will.  From selling fake coronavirus cures online and setting up fake testing stations, to a cyberattack on hospitalsâ€™ critical information systems, criminals are exploiting the COVID-19 crisis.  It's getting so bad that the World Health Organization and United Nations has had to step up it's fight against a proliferation of false information about the virus.

* Phishing and ransomware attacks are on the rise.
* Credentials for more than 500,000 Zoom users were posted on the dark web for sale.
* Cyber criminals are gaining access to the systems of companies or other organizations by taking advantage of remote workers.
* Compromised username and passwords from notable organizations such as WHO, CDC, the World Bank, National Institutes of Health, and other notable groups were used to spread COVID-19 misinformation online.

People should be ashamed of themselves.
