SIZZLE(1)                  General Commands Manual                  SIZZLE(1)

NAME
       sizzle - make a hissing sound when frying or cooking

SYNOPSIS
       sizzle  [-H]  [-L]  [-P]  [-D  debugopts]  [starting-point...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of sizzle.  The most common
       usage of the word sizzle comes from the sound that it imitates, it can
       also refer more broadly to  things that are very hot even  if  they do
       not make any noise.  Sizzling can  describe any kind of great heat and
       is not necessarily specific to a stove, oven or grill.

       When heat is added to any substance,  the molecules and atoms begin to
       get stimulated and vibrate more quickly which makes them more reactive
       to other stimulation.  When it is heated by itself,  pure oil warms up
       evenly and  does  not spit  or sizzle,  but because water is usually a
       part  of  most oil  combinations  the different  densities and heating
       points cause  the water to sink to the bottom and heat  up faster than
       the oil, evaporating into steam and creating a tiny pressurized explo-
       sion. The sound of the water bursting up through the oil is what makes
       a sizzling sound.

       As the jellyfish floats through the vast oceans of life, many experie-
       nces  create  tiny  pressurized  explosions  of  thought.  Like  sound
       bursting through water, that is what is expressed here.


EXAMPLES
       I think there's a little bit of sizzle in here.

       Sudo check out the jellyfish sizzle.

       Sell the sizzle not the steak.

       The full documentation  for sizzle is maintained as a Texinfo  manual.
       If the  info and sizzle programs are properly installed at  your site,
       the command info sizzle should give you access to the complete manual.
       More information can be found in the "About" section of this site.

BUGS
       There  are  security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX
       standard specifies for sizzle, which therefore  cannot  be fixed.  For
       example,  the -exec action is inherently insecure, and -execdir should
       be used instead.  Please see How To Sizzle for more information.
