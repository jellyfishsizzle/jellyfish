To be honest, this wasn't our first choice for Sunday brunch.  However, the place we were originally going to was packed and we needed a plan B.  We'd been to [Noelani's](https://noelanis.com) a couple times before, but never actually considered it for brunch until we walked by and saw it open.  There would have been a short wait for a table, but we opted to sit outside and pretend we were on a lanai while we listened to the island music and relaxed.

How could we have not eaten here for so long?!  I can't believe how amazing everything was.  The food, the service, the atmosphere, it was all spot on.  There were so many things we wanted to eat, we decided we could have brunch some other time so that we could share a bunch of things.  A few of us had pork belly, spam masubi, ahi poke and fried rice while the rest chose to follow through on the brunch plan and have the macadamia nut bread pudding french toast.

All the food was incredible, as was the POG and other large, non-alcoholic drinks.  There are so many great things on the menu I didn't remember, we definitely need to come back for more.  The ONLY complaint was that the bread pudding french toast had unadvertised raisins in it (much to someone's dismay).  Although it worked out in my favor because I got to have more!

Can't wait to come back...
