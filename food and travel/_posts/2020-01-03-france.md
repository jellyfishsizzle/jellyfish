A while back I took a trip to France.  Here are a few of  my favorite photos.  The trip was pretty great and despite the attitude we got in Paris, the rest of the country was very friendly.  We spent a lot of time off the beaten path with a visit to Mont Saint-Michel and Monet's gardens, although the catacombs of Paris were pretty cool too.

Also, I wanted to see how photos looked with the lightbox photo album.
