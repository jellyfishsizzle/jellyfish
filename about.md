The Jellyfish Sizzle
{:.lead}


I have a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Facebook steals your data and does terrible things with it. I went so far as to completely delete my account from Facebook. I'm not a fan of Insta, Twitter, Snapchat or pretty much any other social media. Reddit is my go-to for many things these days, but it's not really the appropriate place for a blog and I'm too lazy to have multiple accounts to keep things more anonymous.


So here we are. Just a blank slate with plenty of space and lots of things I want to say. No "friends", likes, dislikes or funny captions. I might not even allow comments. But for now it is what it is.
